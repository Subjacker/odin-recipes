    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Located right in the heart of Bordeaux steps away from the Grand Théâtre, L’Entrecôte’s menu 
        features one thing and one thing only: 170 grams of sliced beef sirloin served with the restaurant’s 
        famous secret sauce and as many fries as you can eat.</p>
    
    <p>The formula has been unchanged since 1962 since founder Henri Gineste opened the first location of his 
        now popular restaurant in Toulouse. And since, the well-known restaurant has opened locations in 
        Bordeaux, Nantes, Montpellier, Lyon and even Barcelona.</p>

    <p>Now, for the first time, I'm pleased to reveal the mysteries of L'entrecote's secret sauce, 
        so that you can enjoy this french delicacy from the comfort of your own kitchen.</p>

    <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
    <p><em>Serves 6</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g butter</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 good tablespoon of chopped tarragon leaves, fresh</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped chervil, fresh</li>
        <li>4 large basil leaves or 8 small ones</li>
        <li>1 level tablespoon of strong mustard</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1 level teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>5 walnut kernels</li>
        <li>8 to 10 anchovy fillets, depending on size. In salt and oil - not vinegar</li>
        <li>5 large or 10 small capers</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 level teaspoons of finely ground pepper (white or black)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>For the meat: 1.2 kg of sirloin, rib steak or beef tenderloin, 
        to be cut into 2 cm thick slices after frying</em></p>
    <h3>What you'll need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Small saucepan</li>
        <li>Blender</li>
        <li>Electric Whisk</li>
        <li>Large frying pan</li>
        <li>Mixing bowl</li>
        <li>6 plates heated in the oven</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt a little butter in a small saucepan, and fry the shallots for 2-3 minutes over a low heat.</li>
        <li>Add in the rest of the butter and melt slowly.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has just melted, add in the herbs, pepper, nutmeg, capers, and anchovies. 
            Pour all that into a blender, and give it a whizz until everything is finely mixed.</li>
        <li>Put the mustard, egg yolk, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce into a bowl. Give it a quick whisk until mixed.</li>
        <li>Fry your steak on a searing hot saucepan with a little peanut oil. A minute and a half on each side for rare.
            Wrap the steak in foil and leave to rest.</li>
        <li>Pour your warm butter mixture into a bowl, and whisk while gradually adding the mustard and egg mixture 
            until the sauce reaches a mayonnaise-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Prepare a dish, or the sink with a few cm of cold water. Pour 2/3 of the sauce into a saucepan, and
             heat gently while stirring until the sauce begins to split (<em>Do <strong>NOT</strong> allow it to boil, or you'll end up with scrambled egg in your sauce</em>). 
             Immediately place the saucepan into the dish/sink 
             containing the cold water, and continue to stir for a good 30 seconds while the sauce stops cooking.</li>
        <li>Add the contents of the saucepan back to your original sauce, and mix together gently with a whisk, to partially bind the sauce</li>
        <li>Slice your steak, salt your sauce to taste, and serve it all up on a hot plate, along with some french fries.</li>
    </ol>
