    <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
    <p><em>Serves 8-10</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500g sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>320g sheet of shortcrust pastry</li>
        <li>125g butter</li>
        <li>250g caster sugar</li>
        <li>150ml whole milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>grating of nutmeg</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to prepare:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pan with boiling water from the kettle and set over a medium-high heat. 
            Cook the whole, unpeeled sweet potatoes for 30 mins until very tender when pierced with 
            the tip of a sharp knife. Drain well and leave to cool for 10 mins, then peel.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Unravel the shortcrust pastry and use it to line a 
            23cm fluted tart tin. Line with baking parchment and fill with baking beans, then bake for 
            20 mins. Remove the parchment and beans and bake for another 5 mins.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Tip the peeled sweet potatoes into a large bowl with the butter and mash with a potato masher 
            until completely smooth. Tip in the sugar, milk, eggs, spices and vanilla and whisk until 
            everything is combined and smooth.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Tip the sweet potato filling into the pastry case, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake for 
            50-55 mins until the pastry and the surface of the pie is golden and the middle is set. Leave 
            to cool completely in the tin, then remove to a cake stand or serving plate and cut into slices 
            to serve.</li>
    </ol>
